      <h2>What is Docker</h2>
      <p>Your answer here.Docker containers are a popular form of a relatively old operations practice: containerization. Containerization differs from virtualization in that virtualization abstracts away the hardware, while containerization abstracts away the base operating system, too. In practical terms this means we can take an application (or group of applications) and wrap them in a container (or containers) to make them modular, portable, composable, and lightweight. - list all sources you used.</p>
